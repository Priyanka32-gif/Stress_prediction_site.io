Human Stress Prediction 🧠💬
This project aims to predict human stress levels based on textual data using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle, and the model was built using Python libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, NLTK, and deployed through Django for real-time analysis.

📁 Project Overview
Mental health and emotional well-being are critical aspects of a person’s life. With increasing online social interaction, text data from social platforms can help identify users' emotional states. This project focuses on building a predictive model that can classify whether a given text indicates stress or no stress.
